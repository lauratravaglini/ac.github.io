Have you ever wandered aimlessly through the halls and the rooms of a museum...
...and asked yourself why that Picasso is standing right in front of that Gaugin? 
Why Mir√≤ next to Bosch?
Why an ancient statue of the Virgin Mary and a rare copy of the Koran?

Sometimes the association is driven by same style. Other times by same period, or same author, same iconography or provenance.
Whatever the case, together they seem to make perfectly sense. All these individual pieces arranged to create harmony. Just like a collage.

So, in a sense, those big collectors of pieces of art we call museums are, in turn, pieces of art themselves.

The layered surfaces of collages can be torn to reveal parts of the image laying just below their surface... With often marvelous results. 

Same can happen to museums: you can study them upclose, peal off each of their levels and learn more about them to eventually discover what's hiding underneath.

Let's do it. 
Let's pick two you may already heard about, or even visited.
The Museum of Modern Art/MoMa (New York, USA) and the Tate Modern (London, UK).
