Have you ever wandered aimlessly through the halls and the rooms of a museum...
...and asked yourself why that Picasso is standing right in front of that Gaugin? 
Why Mir√≤ next to Bosch?

Sometimes the association is driven by same style. Other times by same period, or same author, same iconography or provenance.
Whatever the case, together they seem to make perfectly sense. All these individual pieces arranged to create harmony. Just like a collage.

The layered surfaces of collages can be torn to reveal parts of the image laying just below their surface... With often marvelous results.

The Museum of Modern Art/MoMa (New York, USA) and the Tate Modern (London, UK).

PROJECT

This website was created by Francesca Borriello, Lorenza Pierucci and Laura Travaglini as part of their final project for the Digital Pubishing and Electronic Storytelling course at the University of Bologna (academic year 2021/2022).

The main objective of the project was to analyse topics related to the field of art, making use of linked open data

The main objective of the project was to analyse topics related to the field of art history, exploiting linked open data as much as possible and taking advantage of the information available on the ARTchives project and other data-driven realities such as Wikidata.

Specifically, our study focuses on the issue of gender inequality, observing the distribution of the male and female component in the history of art, reflecting and analysing the limited visibility of the latter.
